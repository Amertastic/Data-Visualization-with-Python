### Executive Summary
The "Data Visualization with Python" section of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate provided a comprehensive introduction to data visualization tools and techniques using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium. The course covered a range of visualization types, including line plots, area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, and bubble plots. Additionally, advanced visualizations such as waffle charts, word clouds, and choropleth maps were introduced. The course also provided hands-on experience with creating dashboards using the Plotly and Dash libraries.


### Technologies and Libraries Used

 - Python programming language
 - Jupyter Notebook (JupyterLab)
 - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
 - Matplotlib for basic and advanced data visualization
 - Seaborn for advanced data visualization
 - Folium for geospatial data visualization
 - Plotly for interactive visualization and dashboard creation
 - Dash for building web-based dashboard applications.

### Dataset

#### 01 - Matplotlib and Line Plots.ipynb

This Python notebook covered creating data visualization using various Python libraries, including Matplotlib and line plots. It also provided a brief introduction to the pandas library.
